<h3><font face="Arial"><strong>HOMEWORK 3 - due Thursday, October 30<sup>th</sup> no later
than 5:00PM</strong></font></h3>


<p><b> 
Write a C or C++ program that displays a text file on the screen 20 lines at a time. The input file name should be given as
a command line argument. The program should display the next 20 lines after <i>N</i> has been 
typed, or display previous 20 lines after <i>P</i> has been entered (this is an elementary version of the <i>more</i> utility). 

<br><br>

In Windows, the command to clear 
the screen is <i>cls</i>; in UNIX, it is <i>clear</i>. Try <!--either one or the other of --> one of these commands on your system
so that you understand its effects. Then use either <i>system("cls")</i> or <i>system("clear")</i> in your program <!-- just -->
before you write each set of lines to the screen.


<br><br> The input is case-insensitive, i.e. "n" and "N" or "p" and "P" are the same.
