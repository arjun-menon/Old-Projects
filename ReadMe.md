Old Projects
============
A couple of projects I've worked on in the past:

* **Python**
	* [Distributed Graph Algorithms](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms) (2012)
	* [Wolfscript](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Small-Python-Programs/Wolfscript) (2009), an interpreter for a C-like imperative programming language developed in Python for [CSE 307](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/undergrad/cse_courses/cse307.html).


* **C/C++**:
	* [Axiom](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Small-C%2B%2B-Projects/Axiom) (2008), a partially-made experimental interpreter to test out some new language design ideas.
	* [Axis](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Really-Old-C-Projects/Axis) (2005-2007), an interpreter I wrote in high school that contains a hand-written ad hoc lexer and parser. I badly wanted to create a language, and this was the result. (Not knowing that tools like [lex](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/lex/)/[yacc](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/index.html) existed that would have greatly eased my job.)
	* [Sherlock Holmes](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Really-Old-C-Projects/SherlockHolmes) (2006-2007), toolkit for remotely monitoring and executing commands on Windows-based computers. It was never used, besides on my own computer (for testing purposes.)
