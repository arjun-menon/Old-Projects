Old Projects
============
This is an archive of projects I've worked on in the past and am no longer actively working on. Some of the non-trivial ones are:

* **Python**
	* [Distributed Graph Algorithms](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms) (2012)
	* [Wolfscript](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Small-Python-Programs/Wolfscript) (2009), an interpreter for a C-like imperative programming language developed in Python for [CSE 307](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/undergrad/cse_courses/cse307.html).


* **C/C++**:
	* [Axiom](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Small-C%2B%2B-Projects/Axiom) (2008), a partially-made experimental interpreter to test out some new language design ideas.
	* [Axis](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Really-Old-C-Projects/Axis) (2005-2007), an interpreter I wrote in high school that contains a hand-written ad hoc lexer and parser. I badly wanted to create a language, and this was the result. (Not knowing that tools like [lex](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/lex/)/[yacc](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/index.html) existed that would have greatly eased my job.)
	* [Sherlock Holmes](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Really-Old-C-Projects/SherlockHolmes) (2006-2007), toolkit for remotely monitoring and executing commands on Windows-based computers. It was never used, besides on my own computer (for testing purposes.)

### P.S.
There is not much else at the moment. I wish I had worked on more projects in the last several years. I've been programming since the summer of 1998 (age 8), but the programs I wrote before 2004 (in [VB6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_6), HTML/JS & QBASIC  primairly) are not shown here. I started out with [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBASIC) on an old 386 system, spent about 2 years ('98 and '99) on it. Then got a new computer and programmed primarily in VB6, from '00 to '03. Somewhere in between, I picked up HTML 4 (in '00) and the not-so-exciting-back-then Javascript (in '01). I switched over almost completely to programming in C/C++ in '05. In college I coded primarily in Java, Python and C++. I've opted not to share most of the code I wrote in college, as they were mostly written as part of assingments, and there's nothing particularly special about them. I've enjoyed Python a lot in comparison to all of the other languages I've used so far, but miss static type checking on it. My next foray in the world of programming languages is either [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_programming_language), [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_programming_language) or one of the LISPs ( Common LISP, Scheme or [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) ).
