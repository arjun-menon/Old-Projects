Old Projects
============
Here is an archive of projects I've worked on in the past and am no longer actively working on.

* [Distributed Graph Algorithms](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms) (2012)

* Interpreters developed in Python (for [CSE 307](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/undergrad/cse_courses/cse307.html)):
	* [Wolfscheme](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Small-Python-Programs/Wolfscheme), a Scheme-like programming language.
	* [Wolfscript](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Small-Python-Programs/Wolfscript), a C-like imperative programming language.

* C/C++ Programs:
	* [Axiom](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Small-C%2B%2B-Projects/Axiom) (2008), an experimental interpreter to test out some new language design ideas.
	* [Axis](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Really-Old-C-Projects/Axis) (2005-2007), a terrible interpreter with a hand-written lexer/parser combination that I developed in high school.
	* [Sherlock Holmes](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Old-Projects/tree/master/Really-Old-C-Projects/SherlockHolmes) (2006-2007), tools for remotely monitoring and controlling Windows-based computers.

----
There is not much else at the moment. I wish I had worked on more projects in the last several years. I've been programming since the summer of 1998 (age 8), but programs I wrote before 2004 (in [VB6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_6), HTML/JS & QBASIC  primairly) are not shown here. I started out with [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBASIC) on an old 386 system, spent about 2 years ('98 and '99) on it. Then got a new computer and programmed primarily in VB6, from '00 to '03. Somewhere in between, I picked up HTML 4 (in '00) and the not-so-exciting-back-then Javascript (in '01). I switched over almost completely to programming in C/C++ in '05. In college I coded a lot in Python, Java and a bit in C++. I've opted not to share any of the Java code, as there's nothing particularly stellar about their quality. I've enjoyed Python a lot in comparison to all of the other languages I've used so far, but miss static type checking on it. My next foray in the world of programming languages is either [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)), [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)) or one of the LISPs (Common LISP, Scheme or [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure)).
