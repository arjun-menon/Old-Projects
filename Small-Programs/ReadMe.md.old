Axiom is a new programming language that I started working on in 2008, but later lost interest in and moved away. The primary new innovation in the language is a new kind of expression that it allows.

I've also included two assignments I did in [CSE 230](http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse230/) (Fall 2008), a class on *Intermediate C/C++ Programming* taught at Stony Brook University. At the time, my solutions to the assignments were shared by the instructor ([Ahmad Esmaili](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/people/faculty/AhmadEsmaili.html)) with the whole class as exemplary solutions.
